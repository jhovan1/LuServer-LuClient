# LuServer-LuClient
### COSC 650, Computer Networks, Towson University fall of 2015 group project. A Java multi-threaded client-server application.

This project involved creating a client application to make a http request to a server application. The server would read the http request
and then modify the GET request to alter the URL of the request. The resulting request was then made via UDP and the results were read to 
a text file.
